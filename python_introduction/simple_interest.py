#Assign variables for principal, rate, and time
principal = 1000  # Principal amount in dollars
rate = 0.05  # Annual interest rate (5%)
time = 3  # Time in years

# Calculate simple interest
simple_interest = principal * rate * time

# print the result
print(f"The simple interest is:", simple_interest)
